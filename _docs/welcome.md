## What is zoyster?

It's a style guide that plans to hit puberty sooner or later, but for now it's fairly bare.


It's in the same vein as my project [space-case](https://jmacthefatcat.github.io/space-case), where it mainly serves as practice, a way to exercise and develop skill sets. So **zoyster** will slowly blossom with various styles and methodologies that I wish to use when I create anything that represents my personal work, which usually goes under the moniker [zero octave](http://zerooctave.ca).  

As for the name? I just like saying it.
