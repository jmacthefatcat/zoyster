## Logo

The oyster logo. Truly it doesn't *really* look like an oyster, it's just the first thing that came to mind when throwing it together and it kind of stuck. Oyster, world is your oyster? I don't know man, I just work here.

There is also the stamp, which is kind of a knock at the trend slowly passing. The one where every company name had a rectangle outline around it. *Okay, maybe not eeeevery one*.
